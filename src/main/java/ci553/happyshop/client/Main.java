/**
 * The Main JavaFX application class. The Main class is executable directly.
 * It serves as a foundation for UI logic and starts all the clients (UI) in one go.
 *
 * This class launches all standalone clients (Customer, Picker, OrderTracker, Warehouse, EmergencyExit)
 * and links them together into a fully working system.
 *
 * It performs essential setup tasks, such as initializing the order map in the OrderHub
 * and registering observers.
 *
 * Note: Each client type can be instantiated multiple times (e.g., calling startCustomerClient() as many times as needed)
 * to simulate a multi-user environment, where multiple clients of the same type interact with the system concurrently.
