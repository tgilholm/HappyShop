 * The ImageFileManager class handles the file operations related to product images in the warehouse system.

 *
 * - When a product is deleted from stock, its image file is also deleted from the storage location.
 * - When a new product is added or an existing product's image is changed, the image is copied to the specified
 *  destination folder with the product's ID as the image file name, including the original file extension.
 *
 * The class provides utility methods to delete image files and copy them to a new location.
