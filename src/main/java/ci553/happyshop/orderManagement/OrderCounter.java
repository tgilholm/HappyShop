/**
 * OrderCounter is responsible for generating unique, sequential orderIDs for new orders.
 *
 * <p>This class manages a persistent counter stored in an external text file:(ie,"orders/orderCounter.txt").
 * On first use, it creates the file and starts the counter at 1.
 * For subsequent calls, it reads the current number, increments it by 1, writes the updated value
 * back to the file, and returns the new order ID.</p>
 *
 * <p>File access is synchronized using a file lock to ensure safe operation in a multi-threaded
 * or multi-process environment. The method is simple to use by OrderHub
 * or any component that needs to generate order numbers.</p>
 *
 * <p>FileChannel allows exclusive locking of files or specific regions of files,
 * which prevents other threads or processes from accessing the file simultaneously,
 * ensuring data integrity. </p>
 *
 * <p> ByteBuffer allows you to work with raw byte data efficiently.
 * It interacts directly with FileChannel for reading and writing,
 * making file access faster and more flexible than traditional streams.</p>
